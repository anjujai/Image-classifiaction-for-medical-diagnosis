# Image-classifiaction-for-medical-diagnosis
The primary goal of this project is to develop a deep learning-based solution using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify medical images into categories (e.g., "Normal" vs. "Papilloma"). The model aids in automating medical diagnosis by analyzing image data, thus reducing manual efforts and enhancing accuracy.

Key Components:
Dataset Preparation:
The dataset consists of labeled images categorized into classes like Normal and Papilloma.
Images are split into training, validation, and testing datasets.
Augmentation is applied to the training dataset to enhance diversity and prevent overfitting.
Libraries and Frameworks:
TensorFlow/Keras: Core deep learning framework for building, training, and evaluating the CNN model.
Pillow (PIL): Used for image loading and manipulation.
NumPy: Facilitates numerical operations and image array transformations.
Matplotlib: For visualizing training history and results.
Model Architecture:
A sequential CNN model with:
Convolutional Layers: Extract features from images.
Pooling Layers: Reduce spatial dimensions and computational overhead.
Fully Connected Layers: Learn high-level features for classification.
Dropout: Mitigate overfitting by randomly disabling neurons during training.
Callbacks:
EarlyStopping: Stops training if validation loss stops improving to save resources.
ModelCheckpoint: Saves the best-performing model during training for later use.
Training and Evaluation:
The model is trained using augmented data from ImageDataGenerator.
Evaluation metrics include loss and accuracy on the validation dataset.
Results (e.g., training curves) are plotted for insight into model performance.
Prediction Functionality:
A function is implemented to make predictions on new images.
The function preprocesses an image, feeds it into the model, and returns the predicted class along with the confidence score.
